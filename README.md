Small UAV Image Registration Dataset(SUIRD) is a public dataset for image registration/matching research. The SUIRD_v1.0 includes 50 pairs of images and their groundtruth. These image pairs contain viewpoint changes in horizontal, vertical and their mixture which produce problems of low overlap, image distortion and severe outliers.
